## 😎 Philoshopy of Ender's
I am a frontend developer and I feel the need to constantly improve myself to do justice to my work. 
This feeling keeps me motivated. And I can be successful when I'm motivated. This is a must-have golden rule for me. In short, 
if I come to the reason why I use this account, it is to record the information I know, the projects I have done and to present it to other people.

## 🔭  I’m Currently Working on ...
I code the frontend of the sites I like. With the help of the road map I have prepared in my own way, I produce and develop projects on the subjects I am missing.

NOTE: I aim to create a bridge between frontend developers and designer by designing hobby interface designs.

It is an exemplary work.
